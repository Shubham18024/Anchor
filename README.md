# ⚓ ANCHOR
> **“Once my mathematics teacher told me:  
> *Beta, Discipline is the most important thing in life. Without it, you cannot truly succeed anywhere.*”**

“**ANCHOR** exists because I remembered that sentence.”

It's a local-first personal discipline system.  
No accounts. No cloud. No tracking. No manipulation.

Everything lives on **your computer**.

🌍 **Live App:**

## 🌱 Philosophy

ANCHOR is built on a simple belief:

> **Progress comes from honesty, not perfection.**

Most productivity tools optimize for streaks, dopamine, and pressure.  
ANCHOR optimizes for **awareness**, **ownership**, and **truth**.

- You own your data
- Your history cannot be rewritten
- There is no algorithm judging you
- Missing a day is allowed — lying to yourself is not encouraged

ANCHOR is calm by design.

## 🔐 Vault (Important)

The Vault is designed for **sensitive habits** that require honesty.

- Vault data is **encrypted locally**
- There is **NO password recovery**
- Password can only be changed after **7 days**
- Each habit allows **one action per day**
- Relapse and clean days are recorded permanently

⚠️ **If you forget the Vault password, the data is permanently lost.**  
This is intentional — privacy over convenience.

## 💾 The `.swa` File (Data Model)

`.swa` stands for **Shubham’s Web App format**.

It is a deliberate design choice.

### Why `.swa` exists
- No cloud dependency
- No accounts
- No silent sync
- No invisible history edits

### How it works
- **One day = one `.swa` file**
- Each file is a truthful snapshot of that day
- Files are human-owned and portable
- Old files can always be reopened

### Recommended folder : ANCHOR_DATA {Create locally in your PC}

ANCHOR never uploads, syncs, or reads your data without you explicitly loading a file.

ANCHOR does not try to motivate you.  
It helps you **see yourself clearly**.

If it helps even one person become more honest with their time,  
it has already succeeded.
